# Example app using RSpec::Jasmine

This is dummy sinatra application with some spec examples.

## Usage

Install dependencies with Bundler:

    $ bundle install

Run test suite:

    $ rake spec:jasmine

Enjoy!

NOTE: Yeap, one example is failing, it's fine - so you can see how
`rspec-jasmine` handles failed examples.
